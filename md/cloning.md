## Cloning the Repository

Cloning the repository is not as straightforward due to the presence of git submodules.

Please replicate the steps below in Terminal to ensure success.

``` sh
# Clone the repo as usual
git clone https://github.com/lemuelkumarga/<project>

# Initialize submodule
cd <project>
git submodule init
git submodule update

# When cloned, submodules are detached from the HEAD. We attempt to rectify this issue to prevent problems in git
cd shared
git checkout -b tmp
git checkout master
git merge tmp
git branch -d tmp

# Return to original folder if desired
cd ../../
```
